## A New Perspective - A Video Game To Help Regulate Emotions Through Virtual Worlds

This project involved designing a game specifically for adolescents with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). The primary objective was to assist these adolescents in better regulating their emotions in response to everyday scenarios. Additionally, the project aimed to research whether a personalized player-avatar, created using computer vision technology, enhances the user's sense of presence while playing the game.
